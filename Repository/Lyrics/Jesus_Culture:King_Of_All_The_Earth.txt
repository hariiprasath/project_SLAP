King Of All The Earth 
Jesus Culture

Your light, shines through, my darkness, all darkness
Like fire, it consumes, all my fears, and my failures
Your Grace, Overwhelms, Like a flood, straight from Heaven
Your Hope, opens eyes, to the floodgates, of Heaven

Jesus, King of all the earth
Let the Heaven's proclaim Your worth
One True God, defeated the grave
We join with angels and sing Your Praise

Overthrown, is the power, of darkness, all darkness
Lost It's Hold, when You came
With Your kindness, and Your goodness
Your Love, breaks the chains, off my heart, off my mind
Your power, sets free, all the captives, and You bring peace

Oh my soul will sing
Oh my soul will praise You
