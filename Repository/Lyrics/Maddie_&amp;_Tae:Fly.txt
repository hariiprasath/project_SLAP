Fly 
Maddie &amp; Tae

Baby blue staring in the window pane just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she's got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress, now her heart's a mess
Praying that she'll find a way to make it

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Searching for a sign in the night, even like a lonely string of lights
That'll burn just long enough for you to see it
The road's been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There's more to this than just the breath you're breathing

So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

On The Way Down

You won't forget the heavy steps it took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath
And fly

Keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We've come this far, don't you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

Ohh-oh, oh-oh
Fly
Fly
