Chandelier 
Sia

[Verse 1]
Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn
I push it down, push it down
I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love

[Pre-Chorus]
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
Throw em back, till I lose count

[Chorus]
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier,
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night,
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier,
From the chandelier

[Post-Chorus]
And I'm holding on for dear life,
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light,
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life,
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light,
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight, on for tonight

[Verse 2]
Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame

[Pre-Chorus]
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
Throw em back till I lose count

[Chorus]
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier,
From the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night,
Feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier,
From the chandelier

[Post-Chorus]
And I'm holding on for dear life,
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light,
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life,
Won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light,
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight, on for tonight

[Outro]
On for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Oh I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight
On for tonight
