The Burden 
Slipknot

[Verse:]
There's God
Can I feed you again?
Will I have to stay dumb?
You can feel and it begins
But I know inside this heart attack
I can see through your eyes
I'm terrified of everything
But it's no real surprise
Because the parasites are dancing closer
All this sacrilegion warns in posters
Can you handle it?

[Verse 2:]
In the dark
Why I think I'm alone
I swept through my visions
I'm going too cold
Today is a tragedy
In the mouth of the mad
But that doesn't matter now
I've come relaxed
I'm curled up in a ball, and shaking
I'm hiding from the hell I'm making
I can't believe the chance I'm taking
Is there any other way?
Is there any other way?

[Chorus 1]
The burden
The burden

You can't save me
There is nothing more to give
I am changing
Almost like I never lived
Be my witness
Just don't leave me in suspense
Keep this, prove it
Tell them all the consequences

[Chorus 2:]
The burden
Have you ever been burdened before?
The burden
Was there anything you wanted more?

You can't save me
There is nothing more to give
I am changing
Almost like I never lived
Be my witness
Just don't leave me in suspense
Keep this, prove it
Tell them all the consequences

[Verse 3:]
Our same plea
By now you know that looks are deceiving
I'm covered in a rash and receding
Is there any other way?
Is there any other way?

[Outro:]
For gods' sakes we've suffered - this pain is now our lives
For gods' sakes we've suffered enough (x4)
Enough
